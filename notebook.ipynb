    "# Challenge 1: Cross-Task Transfer Learning!\n",
    "\n",
    "## How can we use the knowledge from one EEG Decoding task into another?\n",
    "\n",
    "Transfer learning is a widespread technique used in deep learning. It uses knowledge learned from one source task/domain in another target task/domain. It has been studied in depth in computer vision, natural language processing, and speech, but what about EEG brain decoding?\n",
    "\n",
    "The cross-task transfer learning scenario in EEG decoding is remarkably underexplored in comparison to the developers of new models, [Aristimunha et al., (2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02408), even though it can be much more useful for real applications, see [Wimpff et al. (2025)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06828), [Wu et al. (2025)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09882).\n",
    "\n",
    "Our Challenge 1 addresses a key goal in neurotechnology: decoding cognitive function from EEG using the pre-trained knowledge from another. In other words, developing models that can effectively transfer/adapt/adjust/fine-tune knowledge from passive EEG tasks to active tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ability to generalize and transfer is something critical that we believe should be focused. To go beyond just comparing metrics numbers that are often not comparable, given the specificities of EEG, such as pre-processing, inter-subject variability, and many other unique components of this type of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means your submitted model might be trained on a subset of tasks and fine-tuned on data from another condition, evaluating its capacity to generalize with task-specific fine-tuning."
